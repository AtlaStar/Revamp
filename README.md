# Iridium
Iridium is a new rare ore that generates in the lower layers of the world. It generates in large clumps of up to 24 ores at once, but is extremely rare.
You can smelt blocks of Raw Iridium into Iridium Plating using a Blast Furnace.
Iridium Plating can be applied to Netherite tools and armor with a Smithing Table, until the item in question is fully plated. Then, Iridium tools and Chestplates can have an additional item socketed into it for an extra ability or stat boost.

# Iridium Scepters
On top of the vanilla tools, Scepters can also be crafted with Iridium. They each have unique abilities when socketed, and can be given the Cooldown enchantment to decrease ability cooldown.

# Shulker Bowls
Crafting any stew item with a Shulker Shell will put the stew in the shell. A Shulker Bowl can store up to 16 different stew items, mixing the hunger and effect values of each.

# Transmutation
A Transmutation Charge can be thrown at items on the ground to turn them into another item.

# JEI Integration
All recipes so far have JEI integration.
